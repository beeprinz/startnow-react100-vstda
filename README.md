The prompt for this project was the following:

In this project you are going to build a Todo app using React that allows users to enter their todo items and prioritize them based on their importance.
You will also be able to edit items using the edit link, which should display another form.

Add your own custom functions to handle events:
Update the state when the submit button(s) are clicked
Update the view to show the edit form when a link is clicked
Update the state when the delete link is clicked




This app takes the user's input in the text area along with a priority level selection of either high, medium or low and then saves the user's input onto a color coded list. The user can then choose to edit each item in the list and then save the new text and priority. They may also choose to delete their item from the list as well.
